    "The data was obtained using the Tmdb API. The tmdb_5000_movies.csv has details of the movie and the tmdb_5000_credits.csv has the cast and crew details. On cross-checking with the website for a few movies, it's clear that the information in the dataset is valid and accurate. On checking with IMDB- another website for movie details- the information was matching with the TMDB website. It is unclear what credit_id and cast_id denote. A few entries for crew were not well-formed, and as a result the csv file for credits had extra columns and rows with the crew details. There is no indication of what the cast_id and credit_id denote.\n",

    "The Tmdb website contains reviews of the movies and discussion threads on the movies. This dataset did not include the reviews, discussions and the reviewer's details. The data reflects the data in the website and has not been tampered with. The values for gender of the cast and crew are 0,1,2- there is no indication of the notation. The budget and revenue for a few movies were 0 which are not valid values for the budget of any movie. These values were changed to Null in the database so that the zeros do not bring down the other statistics of the data. Changing them to Null enables us to perform analysis on the reasons for each movie and we may be able to predict the budgets based on the correlation factors such as the genre, year of release, cast,etc.\n",

    "Consistency/Uniformity:\n",
    "The dataset was consistent in terms of the notations used. Spoken_languages had the language abbreviation, and not the entire language name as it appears on the website. The runtime was also converted to total minutes in the dataset. The dataset had consistent values for every column (disregarding the null values). However, there were values of 0 for revenue, budgets and runtimes of the movies- there was no way of estimating the values at this point. \n"
